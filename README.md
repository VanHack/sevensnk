# 7Snk Problem
The project have been developed using Node.js, ES6.

To set the CSV, you need fill the following file on project: resources/7snake.csv

The app was configurated on port 3000.
To start the app is simple:<br>
npm install<br>
npm start

After starting the project, just call in web browser: http://localhost:3000
<br>
It will show the first pair of 7Snake.

To show all posibilities, not just 1 pair, call in browser: http://localhost:3000/all<br>
